# About The Project
This creates a combined front and backend docker container for the "mealie-next" branch of the [Mealie Project](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie)

I take no credit for the Mealie project itself. Currently this repo will build nightly if both the frontend and backend successfully build in the parent project.

Once "mealie-next" officially releases, it will only build when there are new releases.
